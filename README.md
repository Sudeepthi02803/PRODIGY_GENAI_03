This project involves implementing a simple text generation algorithm using Markov Chains. 
The model predicts the next word based on the previous word(s) to generate coherent text.
It includes training the model on a given text dataset and generating new text based on a specified seed. 
The goal is to demonstrate a fundamental text generation approach using probabilistic models.
